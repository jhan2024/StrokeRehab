# Hand Rehabilitation Device Interface - Development Summary

## Initial Interface Design
- Created a desktop application with two main panels:
  - **Side Panel**: For hardware control, visualization, and settings
  - **Main Panel**: For switching between gamified exercises and measurement functions

## Key Interface Components

### Hardware Control Panel
- **Device Status**: Shows connection status with connect/disconnect functionality
- **Touch Visualization**: 3D ellipsoid representing the device with interactive touch points
- **Force Measurement**: Visual bar showing pressure applied to the device
- **Settings**: Sensitivity and force threshold adjustments
- **Panel Toggle**: Option to hide/show the control panel

### Gamified Exercises
- Multiple rehabilitation games including:
  - Flappy Bird (1D control)
  - Mini Golf (direction + force control)
  - Piano Keys (multiple touch points)
  - Subway Surf (directional control with jumps)
- Game cards with visual representations and play functionality

### Measurement Panel
- Real-time force measurement visualization
- Data collection with start/stop functionality
- Results saving capability
- Force vs. time graphical representation

## Interactive Features
- **Force Control**: Spacebar-controlled pressure simulation (hold to increase, release to reset)
- **Touch Visualization**: Click to create temporary touch points on the device
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual indicators for force and touch points

## Implemented Games

### Flappy Bird
- **Implementation**: Integrated based on the popular nebez/floppybird open-source project
- **Adaptations for Stroke Patients**:
  - Reduced gravity (0.15 instead of 0.25)
  - Lower jump power (-3.6 instead of -4.6)
  - Slower game speed (40 FPS instead of 60)
  - Wider pipe openings (160px instead of 90px)
  - Longer intervals between pipes (2100ms instead of 1400ms)
- **Rehabilitation Focus**:
  - Connected to force measurement via spacebar control
  - Variable jump height based on applied force (50-150% of normal jump power)
  - Simple 1D control ideal for early rehabilitation stages
- **Game Interface**:
  - Full-screen immersive experience
  - Score tracking and achievement medals
  - Accessible replay functionality
  - Game launches from main exercise selection screen

## Arduino Integration

### Communication Architecture
- **Web Serial API**: Direct browser-to-Arduino communication
- **Dual Mode System**:
  - Arduino Mode: Real hardware force sensor readings
  - Simulation Mode: Spacebar-based force input for testing
- **Mode Switching**: Seamless toggle between hardware and simulation
- **Browser Compatibility**:
  - Full functionality in Chrome and Edge
  - Simulation-only in Safari and Firefox

### Signal Processing
- Arduino transmits force values (0-1023) over serial connection
- Interface normalizes values to 0-1 range
- Normalized force updates visualization, game control, and measurements
- Configurable force threshold for game control activation

### Force Data Flow
1. Arduino reads analog force sensor values
2. Serial communication transmits values to interface
3. ArduinoConnection class processes incoming data
4. InputModeManager routes force data to appropriate components
5. Real-time UI updates reflect force input
6. Force exceeding threshold triggers game actions

### Implementation Features
- **Game Control Integration**: Force signals mapped to game inputs
- **Measurement Recording**: Captures time-series force data
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time force bar updates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for connection issues
- **Code Structure**: Object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns

## Design Decisions
- Clean, intuitive interface focused on rehabilitation purposes
- High contrast visuals for accessibility
- Temporary touch points reflecting actual device behavior
- Force bar resets when control is released
- 3D visualization of ellipsoidal device for better representation
- Adaptable game difficulty for patients with different abilities
- Dual-mode input system for development and deployment flexibility

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Integrate with Arduino hardware device
2. Implement additional game functionalities
3. ✅ Connect force measurement to device readings
6. Add progress tracking and rehabilitation analytics
