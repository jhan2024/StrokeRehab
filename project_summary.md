# Rehabilitation Device Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a medical rehabilitation device using soft robotics for stroke patients with decreased hand-arm dexterity. The system consists of a silicone membrane hardware component and a user interface software component to enable gamified rehabilitation exercises and progress tracking.

## Problem Statement
Stroke affects approximately 17 million people annually, with 75% experiencing long-term decreased hand-arm dexterity. Current rehabilitation is limited by therapist availability and existing robotic devices are complex with overabundant functionalities. This project aims to create a simpler, more effective tool that:
1. Helps therapists measure rehabilitation progress
2. Enables patients to practice hand movements through gamified exercises

## Hardware Component
- **Silicone membrane/dome** that can be pressurized to mimic stiffness of different objects
- Utilizes pressure sensors to measure force applied by patients
- Capable of detecting touch points/areas on the membrane
- Designed for ergonomic comfort during extended rehabilitation sessions

## Technical Implementation

### Hardware-Software Integration
- **Arduino-based communication** for force sensor data acquisition
- **Web Serial API** provides direct connection between hardware and browser interface
- **Dual-mode system** with seamless switching between:
  - Arduino mode: Hardware force sensor readings
  - Simulation mode: Spacebar-based force input simulation
- **Browser compatibility** management with appropriate fallbacks
- **Real-time data transmission** with minimal latency

### Force Measurement System
- Analog force sensors connected to Arduino analog pins
- Signal sampling at appropriate rate to balance responsiveness and stability
- Raw sensor values (0-1023) normalized to usable range (0-1)
- Value processing pipeline with noise filtering and smoothing

### Communication Protocol
- Serial communication at 9600 baud rate
- Simple text-based protocol with one value per line
- Error detection and connection status monitoring
- Auto-reconnection capabilities with graceful fallbacks

### Game Control Integration
- Force signals mapped directly to game input controls
- Configurable force thresholds for game action triggering
- Identical behavior between hardware and simulation modes
- Variable response based on applied force intensity

## User Interface Requirements

### Patient Interface
- **Gamified Exercises**: Simple games like Flappy Bird, Golf, or music applications
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows pressure applied and progress
- **Customization**: Adjustable difficulty levels for different rehabilitation stages

### Therapist Interface
- **Patient Management**: Create profiles and customize rehabilitation programs
- **Progress Tracking**: View force data and touch accuracy
- **Assessment Tools**: Generate reports and view historical data
